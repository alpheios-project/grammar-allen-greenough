<h2>CREDIT AND REUSE</h2>
<p>Source:&nbsp;<em>Allen and Greenough’s New Latin Grammar for Schools and Colleges</em>, edited by J.B. Greenough, G.L. Kittredge, A.A. Howard, and Benjamin L. D’Ooge. Boston: Ginn &amp; Company, 1903.</p>
<p>This version of Allen and Greenough's classic Latin Grammar is built in <a href="https://www.drupal.org/" target="_blank">Drupal</a> to allow for inclusion of multimedia content. It is based on a digitization carried out by the <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0001" target="_blank">Perseus Project</a>, and replaces an <a href="http://dcc.dickinson.edu/allen-greenough/" target="_blank">earlier html version</a> published by DCC in 2014. <a href="http://latintutorial.com/" target="_blank">Latin Tutorial</a> videos are graciously provided by Ben Johnson. New color charts were created by Meagan Ayer. The content is freely available for re-use under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license.</p>

<p>This version was created in 2013&shy;–2016 under the direction of <a href="http://www.dickinson.edu/site/custom_scripts/dc_faculty_profile_index.php?fac=francese" target="_blank">Chris Francese</a> with support from the Roberts Fund for Classical Studies and the Mellon Fund for Digital Humanities at Dickinson College.</p>
<p><strong>Meagan Ayer</strong> managed the transfer to Drupal. She edited and corrected the original html pages, created the pages and navigation, created the color charts, organized the new table of contents, reformatted the index, and occasionally updated the archaic English of the original.</p>
<p><strong>Kaylin Bednarz</strong> created new photographic page scans, revised and corrected the Perseus XML files, added the original index (which was absent in the Perseus version), and created the html pages for the <a href="http://dcc.dickinson.edu/allen-greenough/" target="_blank">previous version</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Burke</strong> created the web interface for the previous html version and the content type for the Drupal version.</p>
<p><strong>Lara Frymark</strong> updated the links in the new version.</p>
<p>I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Perseus Project for sharing their orginal XML files, and to everyone at Dickinson who helped make this project possible, especially Meagan Ayer, who worked tirelessly to get the details right. If you have any suggestions, or would like to contribute video or audio, please do not hesitate to use the "Suggest an Edit" button at the foot of the table of contents, or email me directly.</p>
